## Sets

* The objects in a set are called its elements or members
* We write 7 &#8712; {2,7,8} and 5 &#8713; {2,7,8}
  * {2,7,8} is a set
* A is a subset of B, written A ⊆ B, if every member of A also is a member of B
* A is a proper subset of B, written A ⊊ B, if A is a subset of B ant not equal to B
* If we do want to take the number of occurrences of members into account we call the group a "multiset" instead of a set
  * Thus, {7} and {7,7} are different as multisets but identical as sets
* We use "..." notation to denote a "infinite set". "..." notation means "continue the sequence forever"
  * Thus we write the set of "natural numbers" N as {1,2,3,...}
  * The set of integers is written {...,-2,-1,0,2,2,...}
* The set with zero members is called the "empty set"
* When we want to describe a set containing elements according to some rule, we write {n | rule about n}
  * Thus {n | n = m² for some m E N} means the set of perfect squares
* The union of A and B is written A ∪ B	
  * Combine all the elements in A and B into a single set
* The intersection of A and B is written A ∩ B	
  * The set of elements that are in both A and B
* The complement of A, written A' or A^c, is the set of all elements under consideration that are not in A
