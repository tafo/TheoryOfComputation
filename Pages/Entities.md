## Definitions, Theorems and Proofs
* "Definitions" describe the objects and notions that we use
  * When defining some object we must make clear what constitutes that object and what does not. 
* After we have defined various objects and notions, we usually make mathematical "statements" about them
  * It must be precise. There must not be any ambiguity about its meaning
* A "proof" is a convincing logical argument that a statement is true
  * The explanation of why a statement is true
* A "theorem" is a mathematical statement proved true
  * A "lemma" is a true statement used in proving other true statements
    * A less important theorem that is helpful in the proof of other results
  * A "corollary" is a true statement that is a simple deduction from a thorem or proposition
    * A "proposition" is a less important but nonetheless interesting true statement
