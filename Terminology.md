Sets

* The objects in a set are called its elements or members

* We write 7 E {2,7,8} and 5 E {2,7,8}

  * {2,7,8} is a set

* A is a subset of B, written A ⊆ B, if every member of A also is a member of B
	
* A is a proper subset of B, written A ⊊ B, if A is a subset of B ant not equal to B

* If we do want to take the number of occurrences of members into account we call the group a "multiset" instead of a set
  * Thus, {7} and {7,7} are different as multisets but identical as sets.
